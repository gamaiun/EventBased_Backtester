"# EventBased_Backtester" 
 
The event-based backtester uses the Oanda API to download and test financial instruments with custom indicators. The goal of this project was to write code that would allow us to test initial trading hypotheses without relying on third-party libraries (such as yfinance and quantstats).

A work in progress.Â
